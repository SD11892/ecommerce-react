The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":10,"id":"4d46f2d0-650b-4b47-9c3f-d5f3f5a91e07"}}}
